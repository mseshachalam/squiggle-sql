 * Class CriteriaExpression is Criteria class extension that generates the SQL
 * syntax for a compound logic expression in an SQL Where clause. The logic
 * expression that the class generates is a list of criteria terms each
 * separated by an {@link Operator#AND AND} or {@link Operator#OR OR} operator.
 * Formally, we may express a logic expression in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;term&gt; &lt;operator &lt;expression&gt;
